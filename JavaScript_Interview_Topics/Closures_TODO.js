/* Closures in JavaScript allow for data privacy and the avoidance of 
side-effects.
This is achieved by nesting functions inside of other functions.
To create a closure, the interior function must return a value or have its value 
passed to another function. This is particulary useful when dealing with async
functions. 
Closures are an important part of functional programming.
